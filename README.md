# About Me

Hi, I'm Maria — a passionate graphic and UX designer with a flair for crafting visual stories that connect. With 3+ years of experience, I specialize in brand identity, digital marketing, UX/UI design, print, and photo editing. My creative journey has led me to design everything from social media graphics and hand-drawn illustrations to custom icons and web layouts. I’m fluent in Adobe Creative Suite, Figma and Procreate.

Inspiration finds me in the wild—through travel, photography, and nature (with a strong cup of coffee always close by).
I'm endlessly curious and thrive on challenges that push my creativity further. Whether it’s designing a user-friendly interface or building a visual identity from the ground up, I bring a mix of strategic thinking and artistic intuition to every project. Collaboration fuels my process, and I’m always eager to work with others who are passionate about what they do.

Let’s connect and create something meaningful together!
